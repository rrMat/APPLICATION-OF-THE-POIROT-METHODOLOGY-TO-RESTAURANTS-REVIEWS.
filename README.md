Natural Language Processing is the domain of science concerned with
analyzing and processing textual information, as the name suggest this kind of
data is not codified and ready to use, but indeed natural. This poses various
challenges, words can have different meanings based on the context in which
they are used or on the user and frequently to understand text is necessary to
have some knowledge of what lies out of it. One particular application of NLP
is to find explanations for a phenomena based on related text, the POIROT
method was developed by professor Gianluca Moro for this exact purpose. This
thesis presents the methodology and to shows one of its possible applications,
given a dataset of restaurants review made available by Yelp, the aim is to find
which are the reasons behind a bad review. It was chosen to focus on extremely
negative reviews because they are the ones that even in a small amount can
influence a restaurant making it fall off the charts, for this reason it is my belief
that there is a lot to be learned from them.
